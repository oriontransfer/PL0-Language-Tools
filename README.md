# PL/1 Language Tools #

PL/1 is a slightly modified version of PL/0. This project is a set of tools designed for educational purposes to learn about compilers, interpreters and virtual machines. It includes a full stack of software required for these purposes, with each component able to be executed independently and typically between 100-300 lines of code.
