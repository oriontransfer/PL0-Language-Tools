# PL/0 Language Tools

The PL/0 Language Tools serve as an example of how to construct a
compiler. The language [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) was
originally introduced in the book "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs",
by Niklaus Wirth in 1975.

![Overview](Overview.png)

This project includes a full stack of tools designed for educational
purposes to learn about compilers, interpreters and virtual machines.
Each component can be executed independently and is typically between
100-300 lines of code.

It is designed to be clear and concise at the expense of performance. It
is easy to extend and modify, e.g. adding new syntax constructs or
machine instructions.

## Install dependencies

* The [ply](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) Python library is used for lexical analysis and parsing.

Optional:
* It is recommended to use the [xdot](https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py#readme) program to view the abstract syntax tree. If `xdot` isn't available, the PDF viewer `evince` is used as a fallback.

### Fedora

	dnf install -y python-ply python-xdot evince

### Debian/Ubuntu

	apt update && apt install -y python-is-python3 python3-ply

### Unix-based

Package names may be similar to the ones above.

For macOS it is possible to use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installer.

### Windows

Open a Command Prompt (press Win + R, type `cmd`) and install Python.

	winget install Python

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) to install the ply library.

	pip install ply

## Basic Usage

Here is a full example using the interpreter:

	$ python pl0_interpreter.py < examples/fibonacci.pl0

	144
	233
	377
	610
	987
	1597
	2584
	4181
	6765
	10946
	-- Stack Frame --
	Constants: {'K': 20}
	Variables: {'m': 17711, 'n': 28657, 'k': 17711, 'count': 21}
	Procedures: {}

Example of using the compiler, assembler and virtual machine:

	$ python pl0_compiler.py < examples/fibonacci.pl0 | python pl0_assembler.py | python pl0_machine.py

	-- Machine State --
	Sequence: [16, 6, 17711, 28657, 17711, 21, 10, 1, 7, 2, 10, 1, 7, 3, 10, 1, 7, 4, 10, 0, 7, 5, 6, 5, 10, 20, 31, 22, 57, 6, 4, 50, 11, 6, 3, 7, 4, 6, 2, 6, 3, 45, 7, 3, 6, 4, 7, 2, 6, 5, 10, 1, 45, 7, 5, 16, 22, 1]
	Stack: []
	Offset: -1

To see the result of lexical analysis and parsing:

	python pl0_lexer.py < examples/fibonacci.pl0
	python pl0_parser.py < examples/fibonacci.pl0

To get a graphical view of the abstract syntax tree:

	python pl0_graphviz.py < examples/fibonacci.pl0

For more advanced usage, including documentation on individual components, please see the [online documentation](http://programming.dojo.net.nz/study/pl0-language-tools/index).

## Cross Compiling

Recent development adds several new compiler targets. I'm interested in the possibility of cross compiling PL/0 to other languages; most of my work on this targets this.

I (Charles) am working on cross compilers for several stack based languages, including Retro, Parable, and ANS FORTH.
